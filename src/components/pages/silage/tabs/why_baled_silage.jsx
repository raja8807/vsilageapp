          Logistics is a key part of your business and needs to be given the
          utmost importance. Especially if you are in farming, where farm feeds
          get spoilt within short intervals, it becomes a mandatory task to make
          silage bales for shipping and other means of transportation.

            <h4>What is Baling?</h4>
            <p>
              Baling is the process of wrapping compacted and inoculated grass
              in polypropylene sheets. The sheets should provide an airtight
              environment for the silage so that the fermentation of the grass
              occurs without oxygen. The high quality of polypropylene sheets
              supports airtight sealing, puncture resistance, and withstands the
              stretching that occurs during storage and transportation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Baled silage by far offers the best fodder preservation method in
              the world because it retains the fodder quality for 1.5 years, the
              size of bales is small enough for easy transportation, storage and
              allows zero wastage (unlike silos and bunkers) and VIFPRO
              introduced the concept of baled corn silage for the first time in
              India with the highest density of 850-900 kg/m3.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>How is a bale made?</h4>
            <p>
              To start with, Bale is usually made with the help of farm
              equipment, appropriately named baler. A baler is a piece of farm
              machinery that is used to compress a raked crop (such as hay,
              cotton, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to
              handle, transport, and store

            There are different types of <b>silage baler machines</b> that are
            commonly used. Some commonly used ones are:
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Rectangular baler</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Square/wire baler</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Cylindrical baler</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            They also come in all shapes and sizes with each serving a different
            purpose and mainly consisting of twine, strapping or a wire. Balers
            have evolved a lot since their debut in the 19th century and are now
            used for myriad purposes, including industrial and agriculture
            sector.

            <h4>a) Increased Quality of Packaging</h4>
            <p>
              The traditional methods of stamping with feet or machines do not
              pack the fodder with enough density to retain the moisture without
              oxygen. In contrast, VIFPRO, one of the best corn silage
              suppliers in India packs the fodder into bales of 850-900
              kg/metre3 density so that fodder retains 35% moisture. It is the
              highest density of baled silage packaging possible in the world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>The current methods of storing fodder include</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Construction of underground or partially underground bunkers
                  costing anywhere between INR 2-25 lakh per bunker.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Storing in huge special-purpose plastic bags.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Storing in regular-sized plastic drums.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In contrast, VIFPRO packs the fodder using special-purpose
              machinery that packs them in bales of manageable size. The size of
              a bale is 85 cm in diameter and 80 cm in height.

            <h4>b) Measurable Quality of Silage</h4>
            <p>
              The quality of baled silage is dependent on how densely the silage
              is packed. VIFPRO has the technology to pack the bales at the
              right density of 850-900 kg/m3. Knowing the DM value of feed is
              important while determining the silage quality and feeding the
              cattle.Baled silage consists of dry matter (DM) and water. Dry
              matter includes the nutritional components such as protein,
              carbohydrates, fibre and minerals.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>c) Ease of Storage for Local Distribution</h4>
            <p>
              Since the bales can be stored in open areas where water does not
              log, farmers can stock them closer to home so that logistics do
              not cost them a lot of money, making dairy farming unviable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>d) Easy Storage for Redistribution</h4>
            <p>
              The bales can be stored in the warehouses of Food Corporation of
              India (FCI), State Warehousing Corporations, Central Warehousing
              Corporation (CWC), the campuses of veterinary colleges that are
              spread across the length and breadth of Maharashtra, or even in
              open areas where water does not accumulate.
            </p>
            <br />
          </Col>
        </Row>
        <br />
        <h4>e) Minimal Pest Management</h4>
        <p>
          As the bales are packed using 20-25-microns thick polypropylene
          recyclable film without oxygen, the pest management required is
          minimal. Also, rodents should be prevented from having access to the
          bale storage area.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In conclusion, the reason why you ought to go with baling is that the
          abundance of moisture content (50 â€“ 60%) during baling reduces leaf
          loss during harvest, which then results in a top quality protein
          source. Baled silage is also apt for your farm if your fodder crop and
          dairy farm are far away from each other, and/or when you do not want
          to be involved in the fodder supply logistics.
        </p>
